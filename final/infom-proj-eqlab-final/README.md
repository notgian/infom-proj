# CCINFOM [S24 Group 3]: ITS Application

## How to Run

Build the application using the build script

```sh
./build.sh
```

Or use the .cmd file (for Windows)
``` cmd
./build.cmd
```

Then run using the following command
```
cd dist
java -jar ITS_APP.jar

```

Or use the `run.sh` file for convenience (will make a windows version once I can test it)
